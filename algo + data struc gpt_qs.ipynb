    "A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node can have at most two children (left and right). A binary search tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree where the left child's value is less than the parent's value, and the right child's value is greater. This property allows for efficient searching, with a time complexity of O(log n) for balanced BSTs. However, a binary tree can degenerate into a linked list, resulting in a worst-case time complexity of O(n) for searching.\n",
